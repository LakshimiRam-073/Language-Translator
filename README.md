# Language Translator

This was a project that was done in [SIH](https://sih.gov.in/) (*a 48 hr hachathon*) It was a National Level **Hackathon** which is being held in all over India


Me and my Team was selected to the Hackathon and went to [Maharashtra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra) and Participated in *SIH*.


Our Problem statement was *To Build a Language Translator using Fuzzy Logic*.

In the very first day we created our *dataset* on our own and the format we used is `json`.

We have implemented Fuzzy using *rapidfuzz* and some *Natural Language processing*.

We tried our best to give the fullest ,but unfortunately the problem statement has been *dropped*.

And the full coding was done in `Python` and we have the front end in `HTML` and `CSS` as well but then the second unfortunate comes, We can't integrate `HTML` and `Python`.


In that case, we used [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to over come the problem.<br>
Anyways we made some beautiful memories with *SIH*.

## How to use?
* Open the folder in the terminal.

* Have fun with the translator.

*The results in the translator may not be accurate, because it was done in 2 days (48 hr hackathon).*
<br>
*It may also have some glitches in the website , Please consider this as my appology, if you have any issues with the accuracy and the website.*
